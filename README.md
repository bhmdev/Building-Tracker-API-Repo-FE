**User Stories**

1. As a user I want to log in to my database.
2. As a user I want to be able to save the buildigs I've seen.
3. As a user I want to be able to login as needed
4. As a user I would want to have the option to change my password as needed
5. As a user I want to be able to track the buildings I want to look potentailly pitch.
6. As a user I want to be able to sign-out of my account so I can keep people away from the buildings I'm thinking of pitching.
7. As a user I want to be able to sign up with my email address to create a login/password.
8. As a user I would like to logout and login as needed.
9. As a user I want CRUD functionality on all buildings so i can keep me records correct.

**Development Process**

Verison 1:

The MVP has a single user creating buildigs that belong to them and can be viewed by them alone.

The first thing I did was to write shell scripts to confirm access to the API endpoints.

Forms were created for the desired functions and the CRUD operations

Events for the submit actions were created and linked to the API calls

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**

- Having a small messaging issue - but will fix.
- SCSS would be the next thing I need to work on
- In the future I'd love to make the user be able to search for a building via a search bar using the parameters of: Building Address/Location, Sq Ft, Built Date, and Price
- I'd also love to have an option to set a particular building with a class i.e. Mixed Use, Retail, Office, Industrial etc.
